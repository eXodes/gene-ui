# Gene UI Library

---

This library is currently under development. Please check again later.

### How to use the library

1. Install the library via NPM.

```bash
npm install gene-ui
```

2. Add the library to your Vue app `main.js`.

```javascript
import gene from "gene-ui/vue";
import "gene-ui/vue/style.css";

Vue.use(gene);
```

> Alternatively, it is possible import the component directly in the Vue SFC file without installing the plugin via `Vue.use()`.

```javascript
import { gComponent } from "gene-ui/vue";

export default {
  components: { gComponent }
};
```

### How to develop new components

1. Duplicate the **template** folder in `src/components` to your respective components type and rename the folder and its contents.

2. Create the new **component base** with the `props`, `events`, `slots` and markup if any.

3. Create the **necessary stories** for the component. These stories will be used as test components.

4. Create **test cases** required for the component and use the stories as the component binding for the test.

5. Update the component `.vue` file to adhere to the test cases.

### How to test new components

1. Currently, the `vite-jest` has minor bug, for the test runner to work, please run `npm run test:clear` once. This would return an error during the first time it's running.

2. After, you can run `npm run test:watch` to test your components.

> Test currently cannot be run simultaneously with storybook due to some bug in vite-jest library
